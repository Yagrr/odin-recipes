      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Add water in container, heat up to 35°C and whisk in yeast to let sit for 5 minutes</li>
         <li>In a large bowl, add and fully mix flour, salt and sugar</li>
         <li>Add the water with yeast to the flour and mix by hand until a relatively smooth dough is obtained (4 minutes)</li>
         <li>Shape dough into a ball, add an abundant amount of olive oil to bowl</li>
         <li>Place dough into bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap to let rise in the fridge overnight</li>
         <li>On a clean work surface, lightly add some dough, then punch down the dough</li>
         <li>Divide dough into 300 g pieces</li>
         <li>Roll each piece into a light ball then put it in a baking sheet, leaving space inbetween each dough ball</li>
         <li>Cover with lid or plastic wrap and rest for 2-3 hours at room temperature or until it has doubled in size</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Sauce and assembly</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Place pizza stone/steel (alternatively, use cast iron pan) in the oven to preheat at max temp (or 340°C ) for one hour before baking pizza</li>
         <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add olive oil, garlic, butter and cook until the garlic turns light golden brown, stirring occasionally</li>
         <li>Add pepper flakes and saute for 20 seconds, stir in tomatoes, sugar, oregano and thyme</li>
         <li>Season with salt, add onion and bring to a simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
         <li>Remove onion, adjust salt levels and fully cool down saucepan content</li>
         <li>Assembly: place dough ball onto lightly floured work surface, then generously flour dough</li>
         <li>Knead dough and stretch it until a 2 to 3 inches-wide round pizza dough is obtained</li>
         <li>Lay pizza dough down, add a few tbsp of sauce in the center then spread it evenly in a circular motion, leaving some edge uncovered</li>
         <li>Add a generous amount of freshly grated mozzarella and pepperoni slices ontop of pizza and place in the oven for 6-8 minutes</li>
         <li>Repeat for the rest of the dough</li>
      </ol>
