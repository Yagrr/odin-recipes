      <h3>Lasagna layers</h3>
      <ul>
         <item>1 lbs (454 g) box of dry lasagna sheets</item>
         <item>1 cup (1/2 pint, 236 mL) cream</item>
         <item>1/2 cup (50 g) grated parmesan or pecorino</item>

         <item>Salt</item>
         <item>Fresh herbs for garnish (e.g., basil)</item>
      </ul>
      <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
      <ul>
         <item>1 lbs (454 g) ground beef</item>
         <item>28 oz (800 g) can of whole peeled tomatoes (as it has more juice)</item>
         <item>Tomato paste</item>
         <item>1 large onion</item>
         <item>1 large carrot</item>
         <item>Olive oil</item>
         <item>Salt</item>
         <item>
            Seasonings
            <ul>
               <item>Garlic & onion powder</item>
               <item>Dried oregano/basil/parsley/marjoram</item>
               <item>Pepper</item>
               <item>Dried chili flakes</item>
            </ul>
         </item>
         <item>Balsamic vinegar or white wine</item>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
      <ol>
         <item>Peel and dice onion and carrot</item>
         <item>Cook them in a little olive oil in a wide pan over high heat until soft and browning (4-5 min)</item>
         <item>Push vegetables to the edge of pan and smash the meat into the center to create a wide flat disk</item>
         <item>Cook until meat is browning then scrape bottom of the pan and stir, using the moisture of remaining raw meat to deglaze (turn heat down at this stage)</item>
         <item>When all the meat has turned color, stir in a squeeze of tomato paste and let it brown for a bit before it burns</item>
         <item>Add can of peeled tomatoes, crush and stir them in to deglaze with its juice</item>
         <item>Add a pinch of salt and seasonings</item>
         <item>Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for at least an hour, stirring occasionally</item>
         <item>Taste for seasoning and stir in a little splash of vinegar</item>
      </ol>
      This will yield more than twice the meat sauce needed for a 8x8 inch lasagna. Put leftover meat in the freezer.

      <h3>Lasagna</h3>
      <ol>
         <item>Heat oven to 180ºC</item>
         <item>Cover bottom of the pan with a layer of cream then lay in the first layer of raw lasagna noodle</item>
         <item>Sprinkle the pasta layer with some salt and chopped garlic, then lay in a layer of meat sauce</item>
         <item>Sprinkle meat sauce with parmesan then lay in another pasta layer</item>
         <item>Repeat until you have 4 layers, with at least a little meat sauce on the top. Drizzle the rest of the cream on top</item>
         <item>Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 45 minutes</item>
         <item>Afterwards, take foil off, sprinkle some mozzarella and bake for another 15 minutes</item>
         <item>At the very end, turn on grill to brown the cheese to your liking (this only takes a few minutes, watch closely)</item>
         <item>Cool for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving with fresh herbs</item>
      </ol>
