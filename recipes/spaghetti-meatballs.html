      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
         <item>Add ground beef, grated cheese, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and a generous amount of black pepper into a bowl</item>
         <item>In a separate receptacle, soak breadcrumbs into milk and soak for a minute</item>
         <item>Lift breadcrumbs out of milk (squeeze milk out of crumbs for firmer meatballs) and add to meat mixture</item>
         <item>Gently mix meat mixture together with fingertips until somewhat homogenous</item>
         <item>Roll meat into balls (approx. 2 cm wide) then let it sit covered and refrigerated for a few hours (preferably overnight)</item>
         <item>Heat olive oil in a wide pan on moderate heat. Add meatballs and cook until one side is browned</item>
         <item>Carefully push meatballs off to the side to brown as much of the other side as possible, be careful not to let the meat burn</item>
         <item>Put the tomato paste in to fry for a bit, then add crushed tomatoes to deglaze the pan</item>
         <item>Stir frequently for 10-20 minutes until the sauce has been reduced according to preference</item>
         <item>Before eating, add grated cheese and freshly chopped herb into sauce then taste for salt</item>
         <item>Boil spaghetti in water until almost done (do not overcook as the spagheti continues to cook due to residual heat)</item>
         <item>Drain spaghetti and mix it in sauce and meatballs, adding some pasta water if the sauce is not liquid enough</item>
         <item>Serve on plate topped with grated cheese and fresh herb</item>
      </ol>
