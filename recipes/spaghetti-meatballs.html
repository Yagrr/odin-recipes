         <li>Milk</li>
         <li>1/2 tsp salt (or more depending on preference)</li>
         <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
         <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
         <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
         <li>Black pepper</li>

         <li>28 oz (800 g) can of crushed tomatoes</li>

         <li>Parsley or basil</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
         <li>Add ground beef, grated cheese, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and a generous amount of black pepper into a bowl</li>
         <li>In a separate receptacle, soak breadcrumbs into milk and soak for a minute</li>
         <li>Lift breadcrumbs out of milk (squeeze milk out of crumbs for firmer meatballs) and add to meat mixture</li>
         <li>Gently mix meat mixture together with fingertips until somewhat homogenous</li>
         <li>Roll meat into balls (approx. 2 cm wide) then let it sit covered and refrigerated for a few hours (preferably overnight)</li>
         <li>Heat olive oil in a wide pan on moderate heat. Add meatballs and cook until one side is browned</li>
         <li>Carefully push meatballs off to the side to brown as much of the other side as possible, be careful not to let the meat burn</li>
         <li>Put the tomato paste in to fry for a bit, then add crushed tomatoes to deglaze the pan</li>
         <li>Stir frequently for 10-20 minutes until the sauce has been reduced according to preference</li>
         <li>Before eating, add grated cheese and freshly chopped herb into sauce then taste for salt</li>
         <li>Boil spaghetti in water until almost done (do not overcook as the spagheti continues to cook due to residual heat)</li>
         <li>Drain spaghetti and mix it in sauce and meatballs, adding some pasta water if the sauce is not liquid enough</li>
         <li>Serve on plate topped with grated cheese and fresh herb</li>
      </ol>
